# CSSHatersClub
Web project for COMP 206 course at McGill University

>The goal of the project was to create a theme based mini social network where users can register, follow each other and post status updates. 
The website consists of 3 pages written in C, Perl and Python.

NOTE: it was also forbidden to use CSS for styling, hence the ironic theme of the website.
